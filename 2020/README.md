This directory contains solutions for Advent of Code 2020, a year that featured diverse algorithmic challenges without a unifying theme.

## Year Overview

2020 presented a wide variety of independent puzzles covering:
- Mathematical calculations and validations
- String parsing and pattern matching  
- Graph algorithms and pathfinding
- Game simulations and cellular automata
- Computational puzzles and optimizations

## Running Solutions

```bash
# Individual solutions
python advent1.py
python advent2.py
# ... etc

# Using the test runner
python ../test_runner.py --year 2020

# Using the enhanced template (for modifications)
cp ../2021/day_template.py day_new.py
```

## Notes

- All 25 days completed for 2020! ðŸŽ‰
- Solutions use the `adventN.py` naming convention
- Each solution contains both part 1 and part 2 implementations
- No shared utilities specific to 2020 (unlike 2019's Intcode)
- Input files follow various naming patterns
